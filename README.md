Tetris Game Project

Bahria University Islamabad - Department of Computer Science  
Project Date: December 28, 2023  
Developed by:

Project Overview

This project is a C++ implementation of the classic Tetris game, developed as part of our coursework in the Department of Computer Science at Bahria University Islamabad. It showcases our understanding of object-oriented programming (OOP), data structures, and algorithms through the creation of an interactive, graphical Tetris game.

Features

- User Authentication: Includes basic user registration and login for game access.
- Interactive Game Board: Displays the current game state, score, and active tetromino pieces.
- Tetromino Functionality: Random generation of tetromino shapes with movement (left, right, rotate) and locking mechanics.
- Line Clearing & Scoring: Completed lines are detected, cleared, and points are awarded.
- Graphical Interface: Utilizes the Simple and Fast Multimedia Library (SFML) for an engaging, graphical user experience.

System Design

The project applies key programming concepts, including:
- OOP Principles: Encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction are integrated into the gameâ€™s design.
- Data Structures: 
  - Stack for tracking tetromino placement history.
  - Queue for managing upcoming tetromino pieces.

Installation

Prerequisites
- C++ compiler (Visual Studio Community 2022)
- SFML Library (available at https://www.sfml-dev.org/) for graphical rendering

### Steps
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd tetris-game
   ```
3. Build and run the project:
   ```bash
   g++ -std=c++17 -o Tetris main.cpp -lsfml-graphics -lsfml-window -lsfml-system
   ./Tetris
   ```

How to Play

- Controls:
  - Use arrow keys to move the tetromino (left, right, rotate, and drop).
- Objective:
  - Stack the falling tetromino shapes to create complete lines, which will clear and earn points.
  - Avoid letting the pieces stack to the top of the board.

Project Structure

- Documentation: Project requirements, design, and timeline documentation.
- Source Code: Includes files for game logic, board display, and SFML setup.
- UML Diagrams: Class and system interaction diagrams for an overview of the OOP design.

Contributors

- Syeda Ammal Asim: Documentation, code for tetromino shapes and board display, file handling, and SFML integration.
- Haseeb Ullah Khan: Project conceptualization, movement logic, level and scoring system, and UML diagrams.
